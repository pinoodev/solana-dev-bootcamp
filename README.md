# Solana Developer Bootcamp Companion Guide

## Introduction

This repository serves as a companion guide for the Solana Developer Bootcamp. While the bootcamp provides a solid foundation for Solana development, I found that some concepts could benefit from additional context and explanation.

This guide aims to:

- Offer supplementary learning resources
- Share practical tips and gotchas encountered during the bootcamp
- Create a more comprehensive learning experience for developers new to Solana

The content here isn't meant to replace the official bootcamp material, but rather to complement it and make your learning journey smoother.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: This is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome! If you're also taking the bootcamp and want to add your insights or resources, feel free to submit a PR.
